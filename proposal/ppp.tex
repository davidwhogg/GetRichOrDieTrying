\noindent\textbf{1. What will be the five-year impact of my work?}
% on one or more of the natural sciences? Is there a key, fundamental

\smallskip

Making \textsl{Kepler} more sensitive.

(Obviating calibration programs for big projects.)

Taking cosmological inference down to the raw pixel level.

Saturating known bounds on inference; in astrophysics you can often compute (roughly) these bounds.

\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{2. How will I advance data-science methodologies?}
% such as statistics, machine learning, automated inference, etc., to
% achieve this goal? We are particularly interested in the ways that
% the data science methodologies that you propose to develop can be
% applied to other fields beyond the one you focus on and
% shared. Please discuss these plans. What work products do you plan
% to make open source?}
\smallskip

Developing and propagating scalable Gaussian Processes.

Building radical self-calibrations with racks and racks of regressions.

Bringing ideas of causal inference into astrophysics.

Working out ideas about probabilistic inference in enormous parameter spaces,
for weak lensing and image modeling generally.

Please submit a three-page supplement to address the two questions
below, keeping the PDF document to standard margins and 11pt type as
in the pre-application.
 
1. What do you envision as the five-year impact of your work on one or
more of the natural sciences? Is there a key, fundamental question
that you are trying to answer? How will you measure progress towards
answering this question over the five years?
 
2. How will you advance data science methodologies, such as
statistics, machine learning, automated inference, etc., to achieve
this goal? We are particularly interested in the ways that the data
science methodologies that you propose to develop can be applied to
other fields beyond the one you focus on and shared. Please discuss
these plans. What work products do you plan to make open source?

Your application materials will be used by staff and an external
review panel to select about thirty finalists; notifications will be
sent out by July 1st.  Those chosen as finalists will be invited to
give twenty minute talks at the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in
Palo Alto, California, on July 28th and 29th. Reasonable travel
expenses will be reimbursed. We anticipate selecting the approximately
15 awardees by late August.

Your FluidReview account at http://ddd.fluidreview.com has been
reactivated to upload your materials. You may also upload an updated
bio-sketch, but this is not required. Please send any questions to
DDDsemifinalists@moore.org.
 
We look forward to receiving your full application by May 12th at noon
Pacific Time.
