The \ktwo\ Campaign 9 (K2C9) data will present new challenges, hereby
unmet by the \ktwo\ team and the \kepler\ community.
The critical difference between K2C9 and previous Campaigns (and the
\kepler\ Main Mission) is that the stars of importance will not be
\emph{isolated}.
That is, the success of K2C9 depends on the success of photometry in a
crowded field.
This means that simple aperture photometry (the basis of almost all
\kepler\ science to date) will no longer be an option.
It also means (as we will describe below) that we need (for the first
time) to understand the detector flat-field at high precision.

There are two general approaches to crowded-field photometry (in our view):
The first is, essentially, to perform \emph{full forward modeling} of the
focal plane, in which the data are fit with a model consisting of a
large number of point sources, a (pixel-convolved) point-spread
function, a DC (or tilted) sky background, and so on.
In this approach, the light curves of the stars will be model parameters
in a baroque model of the whole sky and focal plane.
The second is, essentially, to perform \emph{image differencing}.
In this approach, changess to any star's brightness is seen as a
residual difference between an individual exposure and a reference
image, made by accounting for changes to the telescope pointing (and
PSF, if necessary).

\paragraph{Precise photometry in crowded fields requires an instrument model.}

In this proposal, we are neutral between these approaches for extracting
science from crowded-field imaging.
Our point is that \emph{no matter what kind of crowded-field photometry
we use, we need a high-precision estimate of the detector flat-field}.

In the case of full forward modeling this is perhaps obvious:
The detailed data model is a convolution of the scene with the
pixel-convolved PSF\footnote{From here on, all references to the
  ``PSF'' should be read as ``pixel-convolved PSF'' or what the
  \kepler\ team sometimes calls the ``pixel response function'' or
  PRF.}, multiplied by the flat-field map.
At the precision of \kepler\ data---often parts in $10^5$---the
flat-field matters immensely:
Typical detectors have flat-field variations in the percent range.

In the case of image differencing, we are slightly less sensitive to the
PSF but still sensitive:
When we difference two images, we have to account for small positional
shifts (expected to be fraction-of-a-pixel in the case of K2C9).
If the flat-field is unknown or wrong, the shift of the stars relative
to the pixels does not manifest itself as a pure shift, because light
is moving from one pixel to another, and those pixels have different
sensitivities.
Therefore, to perform image differencing at the information-theory
limit set by the photon noise (the Cram\'er-Rao bound), we need to
understand the flat-field.
And our failure or residuals in the flat-field will translate directly
into noise in the difference image.
That noise will be highest where the image is most crowded where, for
the microlensing applications that are the target of this proposal,
the signals are most likely to appear.

In principle, to perform photmetry at the information-theory limit,
we need to know not just the flat-field but also the PSF, the bias,
the dark (or zero), and properties of the sky.
(If you really want to go to town, there is (in principle) a different
flat-field that applies to sky photons as applies to star photons,
because of the differences in which the sky and a star illuminate the
spacecraft.)
Here we propose to infer everything we need to perform precise
photometry, but with a strong emphasis on the flat-field, which we
think will lead to dominant systematic-noise terms in the extracted
photometry, given current techniques and spacecraft (s/c) knowledge.
For example, as long as sources are bright, the star flux dominates
over the background; in addition, if images are being differenced, the
difference signal is not expected to be a crowded field, even though
the direct image is.
These properties of the K2C9 microlensing data, thought of as an
image-differencing project, much more sensitive to the flat-field than
any other aspect of the s/c imaging.

One important and relevant thing, but which is \emph{not} part of this
proposal, is that everything we achieve in K2C9 will improve photometric
measurements in other Campaigns, at least where they overlap the
telemetry region of K2C9.
Also, all of the techniques and codes we develop will be released
open-source (as is all the work we do), so they can be employed to
infer s/c properties for other Campaigns and other missions.

\paragraph{We perform forward modeling of the s/c to learn instrument model parameters.}

PSF-convolved scene, sky background, sky and star flats.  Striping.  Etc.
