\textbf{New Probabilistic Approaches to Cosmology}
\smallskip

New imaging and spectroscopic astronomical surveys present
increasingly ambitious challenges and opportunities for cosmology.
We want to measure smaller signals with larger numbers of galaxies
observed at lower signal-to-noise ratios.
These goals, in the long, run, will require us to perform data
analyses that are as information-preserving as possible.

In particular, the standard method of
