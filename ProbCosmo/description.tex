...The theory of experimental cosmology

...Standard practice in cosmology today:
For example, in typical large-scale structure surveys, the standard
method of imaging the sky, creating a catalog of sources, obtaining a
best value for each source's redshift, computing a standard point
estimate of the auto-correlation function, and then performing
cosmological inferences on that correlation function, is a daisy-chain
of lossy data-analysis steps.

...Aside:  Bias--variance trade-off.

...Why doing the right thing would be hard

...Example:  Using p(z) in standard large-scale structure!

...Stage-III and Stage-IV projects and probabilistic outputs.

...What have we achieved so far?

...In exoplanets

...In weak lensing; \thetractor.

...How are we making these things possible?  Applied-math developments

...Very fast GPs

...Samplers that don't require tuning

...Importance sampling for hierarchical inference

...Aside:  $p(d\given z)$ vs $p(z\given d)$

...Aside:  ABC on cosmological data

...Pedagogical role in the community
