David W. Hogg is a Professor of Physics at New York University and the
Deputy Director of the NYU Center for Data Science, with an Adjunct
Staff Senior Scientist position at the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr
Astronomie in Heidelberg, Germany.  His research is focused on the
areas of astronomy in which probabilistic inference, computational
statistics, and applied mathematics are of greatest benefit.  These
include making cosmological inferences in large astronomical surveys,
calibrating astronomical imaging and spectroscopic devices, and
searching for the (incredibly tiny) observational signatures of
extra-solar planets.
