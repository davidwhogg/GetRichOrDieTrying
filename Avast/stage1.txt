Data-driven approaches for extreme precision radial-velocity measurement.

David W. Hogg (NYU)

In a forward-looking move, NASA has partnered with NSF to create
NN-EXPLORE, a project to provide extremely high precision ground-based
radial velocity measurements for exoplanet discovery and
characterization. The instrument NEID being built for this partnership
will be an extremely stable and precise spectrograph. In addition to
NEID, there are multiple existing and new projects world-wide to
provide large numbers of extreme precision radial velocities for the
follow-up of NASA-led exoplanet discoveries. Typically these
spectrographs produce internal precisions, or theoretically best-case
measurement noise, on the order of 0.1 m/s. This is precise enough to
detect and characterize Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars!

At the present, no spectrographs are returning stellar measurements
with empirical scatter below something like 1 m/s. There are many
reasons for the mismatch between the theoretical (0.1 m/s) and
empirical (1 m/s) precisions: Spectrograph calibration is non-trivial;
there are spectral distortions from flexure and atmospheric
conditions; stars oscillate seismically; stellar surfaces are heaving
stochastically with convection; and there are spots and time-dependent
activity on the rotating stellar surface. Preliminary work by my group
suggests that convection may dominate these effects for quiet,
Sun-like stars, but this is by no means demonstrated.
