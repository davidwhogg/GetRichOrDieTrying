\paragraph{What are the sources of radial-velocity noise?}
Laundry list it. Refer to literature. Discuss the basis on
which the quantitative estimates have been made.

Few open-source pipelines. MB only knows of one.

No open-source pipelines get down to m/s precision.

\paragraph{Surface convection:}
CITE papers Bedell sent. Use the word ``granulation''.

Say ``convective blue-shift effect'' (look that up).

Interplay of convection and rotation. Interplay of spots and convection.

\paragraph{Activity and sunspots:}
Show results we have in hand now.

Plages may suppress convection locally. So change the net convective signal.

Interplay of spots and rotation. But rotations aren't always visible.

latitude dependence to sunspots of possible relevance.

\paragraph{Asteroseismic modes:}
CITE relevant HARPS results.

P-modes would dominate if we integrated over times shorter than 5 mins.

\paragraph{Planetary system and companion noise:}
Concept of adversarial planetary system. And other sub-stellar and stellar companions.

Also dilution of spectrum by companions can alter the spectral shape.

Very localized dust orbiting within the planetary system. Like gas
coming off very hot Jupiters, or accreting zodi. Freakin' comets.

\paragraph{Extra-solar technology}

\paragraph{Interstellar lines:}
Could there be micro-DIBs? Could there be micro-PAHs?

Certain lines exist in the ISM as well as the stellar photosphere. Ca
lines are polluted by the ISM and therefore might be thrown off as
pure activity indicators.

What about line-of-sight changes in the ISM? Like relative motions
between the star and ISM. Like stars that produce ISM jets.

\paragraph{Cosmic rays:}
Could these possibly matter?

Could fuck up continuum normalization?

\paragraph{Atmosphere and tellurics and micro-tellurics:}
Quantifying the influence of micro-tellurics.

Variable velocity structure and water and CO2 and dust content to the atmosphere.

Are there differential refraction issues if the astrometry is wrong?

(Possible sunlight or moon scattering injection into the spectral aperture.)

\paragraph{Telescope optics}
Flecture, and fiber. The position of the star on the fiber, and the
incomplete ``scrambling'' in the fiber.

\paragraph{Spectrograph calibration:}
Accuracy and precision of the wavelength solution.

Combs and gas cells.

If lamps, long-term changes in the lamps.

LSF as a function of wavelength.

Hierarchical self-calibration---living the dream.

\paragraph{Photon noise:}

\paragraph{Data extraction and analysis:}
Two-d to one-d extraction and distortions to line shapes?

CRs appear again here.

Internal reflections of the spectrum inside the spectrograph.

CCV has to be stable to movements of the spectrum relative to the
pixels. Edge effects, and flat-field effects, other detector effects.

CCV should be using accurate spectral and telluric models.

Barycentric corrections.

Working entirely in 2-d---living the dream. Some systematics will be
simpler or more apparent in 2-d than the individual 1-d orders.

\paragraph{Why me? Why now?}

\paragraph{Component 1---A quantitative noise budget for the \HARPS\ data:}
A set of procedures for assessing the 

\paragraph{Component 1a---Cross-correlation radial velocities:}
Comments on the relationship to max-like. How things go wrong
if the templates are bad, or if there are unmodeled components?
Possibility that some of the noise budget comes from these
problems. Cosmic rays. Tellurics. Etc.

\paragraph{Component 1b---Something else:}

\paragraph{Component 1c---Causal inference on the noise budget:}

\paragraph{Component 1x---Other projects:}
Interpolation onto a common grid / combined spectrum.

\paragraph{Component 2---Reducing noise by modeling nuisances:}

\paragraph{Component 2a---A non-parametric model for an observed spectrum:}
Modeling spectrum, tellurics, and ISM all with some kind of
process (probably Gaussian process).

Make remarks about very fast linear algebra.

\paragraph{Component 2b---A finite-dimensionality tellurics and interstellar model:}
How we can look at the variability in the tellurics.
How we can determine the principal directions of variation.
How we can capitalize on these results.

Emphasize that we can use all stars ever observed with \HARPS\ to
build and support this model.

\paragraph{Component 2c---Spectral signatures of convection (and other nuisances):}
Convection is not activity! But open with wavelength-dependence of
activity and activity indicators.

\paragraph{Component 2d---Hierarchical models for the time domain:}
Ultimately, we have very strong prior beliefs about some aspects
of the radial-velocity variability. For examples: The orbital
companions imprint Kepler-like variations. The asteroseismic modes
imprint combs of quasi-periodic signals. The convection is stochastic
but with identifiable time covariance.

\paragraph{Component 2x---Other possible projects:}
Other projects. Laundry list.

\paragraph{Prior \NASA\ support:}
The \GALEX\ and \Ktwo\ projects are of great relevance.

\paragraph{Management and timeline:}
Very lean project; just the PI, unfunded collaborators, and graduate students.
