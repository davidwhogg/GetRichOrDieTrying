\noindent
From a fundamental perspective, there is essentially no limit to how
precisely we might measure the radial velocity of the center of mass
of a distant star with an extreme precision radial-velocity (\EPRV) spectrograph.
Of course in real life, there are real limits, set
by (for example) photon noise, stellar surface convection and activity,
variations in the atmosphere, and spectrograph flexure and illumination. In practice,
essentially no stars have had their center-of-mass velocities measured
consistently with an empirical scatter (\acronym{RMS} around the mean,
say) smaller than $1\,\mps$.

At the same time, \EPRV\ is responsible for hundreds of \foreign{ab initio}
exoplanet discoveries and many hundreds more \foreign{a posteriori}
characterizations of planets
discovered elsewhere. That is, \EPRV\ is hugely successful.
Because most of the discoveries and characterizations have been made
at or near precision limits---that is, near what is detectable at noise levels
greater than $1\,\mps$ per epoch---\hl{any improvement in precision directly
translates into increased scientific return on investment},
both from existing archival data and from new data from new programs.

This is promising! Most of the noise sources \emph{other} than photon noise
are generated by macroscopic physical processes that are amenable to both
physical and statistical modeling and prediction. And we have enormous amounts
of data in hand, and far more to come. That opens up the hope
that we can apply data-driven models to these nuisances and directly improve
\EPRV\ precision (and therefore capabilities). \hl{This proposal is to quantify
these nuisances, develop a justifiable plan for addressing the tallest
(addressable) poles first, and then building models that address those tall
poles.}

This proposal begins with a context-setting discussion of the sources
of noise in \EPRV\ experiments---where we are being very liberal in the definition of the
word ``noise''---followed by a set of proposed activities. The activities fall into two
separate \emph{Components}: Component~1 is about understanding the relative
(and absolute) contributions of different kinds of noise. Component~2
is about building models of noise sources---nuisances---that will
deliver improved precision for future experiments and especially \NASA's
\NNEXPLORE\ program. Each of the two Components of the proposed activities
further subdivide into subcomponents of varying levels of specificity.

\paragraph{What are the sources of radial-velocity noise?}
There are many possible motivations for precisely monitoring the radial
velocity of a star.
If, however, the goal is the detection and characterization of exoplanets,
then many of the physical effects that put radial-velocity imprints into
a spectrogram are nuisances, or confusing.
These nuisances will be referred to as ``noise'' in what follows.

One comment: The goal of \EPRV\ is to measure the \emph{center of mass} of
the target star.
It is this center-of-mass motion that reflects the exoplanetary system motions.
Some of the noise sources we discuss here affect the velocity of the star,
but the velocity of the \emph{surface} of the star. That is, they mask the
motion of the center of mass, which is our target.

The sources of noise that follow are listed in a \emph{causal order} along the
line of sight from the star to the data analyst.

\paragraph{Surface convection:}
CITE papers Bedell sent. Use the word ``granulation''.

Say ``convective blue-shift effect'' (look that up).

Interplay of convection and rotation. Interplay of spots and convection.

\paragraph{Asteroseismic modes:}
CITE relevant HARPS results.

P-modes would dominate if we integrated over times shorter than 5 mins.

\paragraph{Activity and sunspots:}
Show results we have in hand now.

Plages may suppress convection locally. So change the net convective signal.

Interplay of spots and rotation. But rotations aren't always visible.

latitude dependence to sunspots of possible relevance.

\paragraph{Planetary system and companion noise:}
We now know that many stars---perhaps literall all stars---host some
kind of planetary system.
Many of these include close-in planets and probably asteroids, comets,
and zodiacal dust.
There are many modes by which these extra-solar systems can put
confusing or noisy imprints on \EPRV data.

Concept of adversarial planetary system. And other sub-stellar and stellar companions.

Also dilution of spectrum by companions can alter the spectral shape.

Very localized dust orbiting within the planetary system. Like gas
coming off very hot Jupiters, or accreting zodi. Freakin' comets.

Extra-solar technology!

\paragraph{Interstellar lines:}
Could there be micro-DIBs? Could there be micro-PAHs?

Certain lines exist in the ISM as well as the stellar photosphere. Ca
lines are polluted by the ISM and therefore might be thrown off as
pure activity indicators.

What about line-of-sight changes in the ISM? Like relative motions
between the star and ISM. Like stars that produce ISM jets.

\paragraph{Cosmic rays:}
Could these possibly matter?

Could fuck up continuum normalization?

\paragraph{Atmosphere and tellurics and micro-tellurics:}
Quantifying the influence of micro-tellurics.

Variable velocity structure and water and CO2 and dust content to the atmosphere.

Are there differential refraction issues if the astrometry is wrong?

(Possible sunlight or moon scattering injection into the spectral aperture.)

\paragraph{Telescope optics}
Flecture, and fiber. The position of the star on the fiber, and the
incomplete ``scrambling'' in the fiber.

\paragraph{Spectrograph calibration:}
Accuracy and precision of the wavelength solution.

Combs and gas cells.

If lamps, long-term changes in the lamps.

LSF as a function of wavelength.

Hierarchical self-calibration---living the dream.

\paragraph{Photon noise:}

\paragraph{Data extraction and analysis:}
Two-d to one-d extraction and distortions to line shapes?

CRs appear again here.

Internal reflections of the spectrum inside the spectrograph.

CCV has to be stable to movements of the spectrum relative to the
pixels. Edge effects, and flat-field effects, other detector effects.

CCV should be using accurate spectral and telluric models.

Barycentric corrections.

Working entirely in 2-d---living the dream. Some systematics will be
simpler or more apparent in 2-d than the individual 1-d orders.

\paragraph{Why me? Why now?}
Here we discuss successes with previous projects.

And here we also discuss \NNEXPLORE, and the new context for
\NASA\ Exoplanet Research.

Few open-source pipelines. MB only knows of one.

No open-source pipelines get down to m/s precision.

\paragraph{Component 1---A quantitative noise budget for the \HARPS\ data:}
A set of procedures for assessing the 

\paragraph{Component 1a---Cross-correlation radial velocities:}
Comments on the relationship to max-like. How things go wrong
if the templates are bad, or if there are unmodeled components?
Possibility that some of the noise budget comes from these
problems. Cosmic rays. Tellurics. Etc.

\paragraph{Component 1b---Something else:}

\paragraph{Component 1c---Causal inference on the noise budget:}

\paragraph{Component 1x---Other projects:}
Interpolation onto a common grid / combined spectrum.

\paragraph{Component 2---Reducing noise by modeling nuisances:}

\paragraph{Component 2a---A non-parametric model for an observed spectrum:}
Modeling spectrum, tellurics, and ISM all with some kind of
process (probably Gaussian process).

Make remarks about very fast linear algebra.

\paragraph{Component 2b---A finite-dimensionality tellurics and interstellar model:}
How we can look at the variability in the tellurics.
How we can determine the principal directions of variation.
How we can capitalize on these results.

Emphasize that we can use all stars ever observed with \HARPS\ to
build and support this model.

\paragraph{Component 2c---Spectral signatures of convection (and other nuisances):}
Convection is not activity! But open with wavelength-dependence of
activity and activity indicators.

\paragraph{Component 2d---Hierarchical models for the time domain:}
Ultimately, we have very strong prior beliefs about some aspects
of the radial-velocity variability. For examples: The orbital
companions imprint Kepler-like variations. The asteroseismic modes
imprint combs of quasi-periodic signals. The convection is stochastic
but with identifiable time covariance.

\paragraph{Component 2x---Other possible projects:}
Other projects. Laundry list.

\paragraph{Prior \NASA\ support:}
The \GALEX\ and \Ktwo\ projects are of great relevance.

\paragraph{Management and timeline:}
Very lean project; just the PI, unfunded collaborators, and graduate students.
